# mountains-website
This project was a skills test I had to complete in 1 hour. [The initial version of the project can be found by looking for the second commit](https://github.com/kalvingarcia/mountains-website/tree/492a27107a8839c47cc65ec90faf55c35ad1dd3b), but I will be adding more to showcase my front end development skills.
